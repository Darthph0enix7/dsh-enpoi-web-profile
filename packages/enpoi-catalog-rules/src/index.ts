/**
 * enpoi-catalog-rules — dynamic rule/filter engine for the model catalogue.
 *
 * Reads `enpoi-orchestration.catalogRules` (rules as data, versioned and
 * operator-editable) and the synced `llm-pi-ai` catalogue, then provides the
 * `catalogRules` service other plugins and UI surfaces resolve through:
 *
 *   ctx.get('catalogRules').visibility()             // every decision + warnings
 *   ctx.get('catalogRules').decide(provider, model)  // picker fast path
 *   ctx.get('catalogRules').expandSelector(selector) // group selector → links
 *   ctx.get('catalogRules').previewRulesChange(raw)  // before/after edit diff
 *
 * Rules are evaluated fresh on every settings update; the engine publishes only
 * its derived `catalogRules.resolved` decision map (never the rules document)
 * and never deletes catalogue entries (hide ≠ delete). On a host that serves
 * the settings artifact channel the map is published there instead of into the
 * configuration document, so publishing it costs no document revision, profile
 * write, Loader reload, or whole-document fan-out; a pre-artifact host keeps
 * the legacy document write. All warnings go to stderr — this harness's logger
 * drops info/warn, so stderr is the observable channel.
